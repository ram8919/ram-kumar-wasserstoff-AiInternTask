# Building an AI Pipeline for Image Segmentation and Object Analysis 


## Usage Guidelines
1. Upload an image through the Streamlit UI.
2. View the segmented objects and extracted data.
3. Download the final output image and table.

## Approach and Implementation
The pipeline consists of the following steps:
1. **Image Segmentation**: Segmenting objects using Mask R-CNN.
2. **Object Extraction**: Extracting and saving each object.
3. **Object Identification**: Identifying objects using YOLO.
4. **Text Extraction**: Extracting text using Tesseract OCR.
5. **Summary Generation**: Summarizing object attributes.
6. **Data Mapping**: Mapping extracted data to objects.
7. **Output Generation**: Generating the final annotated image and data table.

## Results
- Accurate segmentation and identification of objects.
- Efficient text extraction and summarization.
- Clear visual output and data mapping.

## Challenges
- Handling diverse and complex images.
- Ensuring robustness and efficiency.

## Future Work
- Improve model accuracy and performance.
- Expand the pipeline to support more image formats and types.
