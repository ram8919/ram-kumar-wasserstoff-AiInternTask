# Building an AI Pipeline for Image Segmentation and Object Analysis 



## Approach and Implementation

I will use Mask R-CNN for segmenting objects within an input image.
Deliverable: Segmented regions of each object and visual output showing segmented objects.

## Object Extraction and Storage

I will extract each segmented object from the image and store them separately with unique IDs.
Deliverable: Saved object images with metadata.

## Object Identification

I will identify and describe each object using YOLO.
Deliverable: Descriptions for each object image.

## Text/Data Extraction from Objects

I will extract text/data from each object image using Tesseract OCR.
Deliverable: Extracted text/data for each object.

## Summarize Object Attributes

I will summarize the nature and attributes of each object.
Deliverable: Summarized attributes for each object.

## Data Mapping

I will map unique IDs, descriptions, extracted text/data, and summaries to each object.
Deliverable: Data structure representing the mapping.

## Output Generation

I will generate the final output image with annotations and a table containing all mapped data.
Deliverable: Final visual output and summary table.

## Results

The pipeline accurately segments and identifies objects in various images.
Extracted text and data are processed and summarized efficiently.
The final output provides a clear and detailed analysis of the input image.

# Challenges

Handling diverse and complex images.
Ensuring robustness and efficiency of the pipeline.

## Future Work

Improve model accuracy and performance.
Expand the pipeline to support more image formats and types.
